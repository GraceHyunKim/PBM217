PBM 217 Statistics and Data Analysis in Biomedical Physics
									Winter Quarter 2025
This course consists of two distinct, but related parts.  One part is the introduction to computer-based statistical concepts, data analysis, and experimental design within biomedical physics research. Standard statistical packages and various statistical computing algorithms on relevant data sets within the radiological sciences. These concepts will be taught primarily by Dr. Kim on Tuesdays. The second part is the introduction to communicating scientific results. We will use conference abstracts as the primary examples here. These concepts will be taught primarily by Dr. McNitt-Gray on Thursdays. Because of the advanced statistical concepts, experience with data analyses and abstract preparation taught in this course, this class will be most beneficial for second year graduate students.  The final project will bring both of these parts together where the student will prepare an abstract using their own data (or data that is provided by the instructors) and which will include statistical analysis; the supporting data of the abstract will include at least one table and at least one plot.

Communicating Scientific Results Topics (Thursdays – Dr. McNitt-Gray)
1.	Introduction to the abstract – describing your research briefly and clearly. What is an abstract and what goes into it
2.	Titles and Purpose statement – examples (both good and bad); what makes a good title? A good purpose statement? What is an example of a Clear purpose statement? 
3.	Methods – describing them briefly; data, data collection, analysis methods, statistical tests
4.	Results – Brief descriptions of results (highlights); relating results to methods
5.	Discussion/Conclusion – what do results tell us? Did we answer the purpose? Again, good and bad examples
6.	Supporting data – one page examples of supporting data; what is the purpose of supporting data?  What are you trying to show? How can you show it? 
7.	Putting it all together – abstract and supporting data
8.	Reviewing and critiquing abstracts (yours and others)

Data Sources for the Final Project: 
Each student can choose dataset based upon his/her own interest from a lab or select the dataset in the publicly available dataset such as Kaggle, https://www.data.cdc.gov, https://oriseapps.orau.gov/cedr/analytic_dfs.aspx, https://www.library.ucla.edu/social-science-data-archive/data-portals.  

Course Assignments & Exams
Weekly Assignments 20%, Participation 15%, In-Class Presentation (Midterm) 30%, Final Abstract 35%  
Weekly Assignments (20%)
Homework assignments will only be accepted for 24 hours following the designated due date and time. It is expected that a portion of each homework assignment will be completed during lab but that time will still need to be dedicated to completing the assignment outside of the weekly lab hour. 
Class Participation (15%)
Class participation will be graded by the group discussion during the class and the comments during Monday and Wednesday classes.  
In-Class Presentation & Discussant of a given topic (30%)
The Mid-Quarter exam will be replaced by in-class presentation of video module and reading assignment. The Mid-Quarter Project will be graded on a scale ranging from 0-100. In the instance a topic that is not able to be presented or discussed, 10 points will be deducted for each hour late.
Final Project (Abstract & Future Study Design)  (35%)
The Final Project will be submitted via the course website and will be due on Thursday, March 23h by 5:00 PM. The Final Project will be graded on a scale ranging from 0-100. In the instance that projects are submitted late, 10 points will be deducted for each hour late. 
The Final Project consists of two parts: (a) Final Abstract, and (b) Future study design
The Final Abstract will draw upon the skills students have learned throughout PBM 217 with emphasis on the material covered in Weeks 1-10. Students will be expected to employ statistical methods for the management, modeling, and analysis of datasets with several variables that may be dependent on one another using statistically rigorous methods. Students will be responsible for preparing and organizing a written presentation (abstract) containing one table, one figure, and a text summary of methods and results with 300 words limit. The Final Abstract should be prepared as though being disseminated to a non-statistical audience of public health professionals. Students will be graded on the presentation of their reports (300 words and one page of supplementary including one table and one figure), including visual appeal and clarity of results presented. Students will also be asked to submit their statistical programs.
